retrace
=======

A command line utility to regenerate stack traces for minified Dart applications compiled with dart2js.

Installation
------------

pub global activate retrace

Usage
-----

retrace takes a source map file generated by dart2js and a stack trace and combines it into a readable stack trace.
For example:

    bash$ dart2js someapp.dart

produces the following files

    someapp.dart.js
    someapp.dart.js.map

To run a retrace, paste the stacktrace into the console and add a newline to receive the output:

    bash$ retrace someapp.dart.js.map
    Paste your minified trace here:
    ArgumentError - foo is null
        at Error (native)
        at WK.X4 (http://www.someapp.com/someapp.dart.js:7106:31)
        at lx.R1 (http://www.someapp.com/someapp.dart.js:5358:5)

    ArgumentError - foo is null
        at Error (native)

        at someapp/base.dart:458                        setupAudio  (col 12)
